# Python NLP the project using Python to explore the customer's reviews from Amazon database
# Within this project, we use Python to establish a system using several ML (machine learning) approaches to train and anticipate the customer's positive or negative opinions in the review feedbacks.
# we also add a new feature allowing the system to update its lexicon overtime to ensure the mining system is able to maintain its ability of prediction from the majority missleading factors such as (1) different categories of the input statements and (2) new or wrong spelling vocabularies
